Git & GitHub 
Git and GitHub are tools that help us save and manage our code properly.
Git:
Git is a tool used to keep record of changes in our project.
When we write or update code, Git remembers what we changed and when we changed it.
If we make a mistake, we can go back to the old version of the file.
Git works mainly on our computer.
It helps us not to lose our code.

GitHub:
GitHub is a website where we can store our Git projects online.
We can upload our code to GitHub and use it from anywhere.
We can also share our project with other people.
GitHub helps us to work with friends or team members on the same project.

Uses:
Save our code safely Go back to old versions if needed Share projects with others,
Work in a group,
Learn from other's projects,
They make coding easy and safe.

Basic Git Workflow
The basic steps of Git are:
1. Create or download a project (repository).
2. Make changes in files.
3. Add files using git add.
4. Save changes using git commit.
5. Send files to GitHub using git push.
6. Get updated files from GitHub using git pull.
These steps help us keep our project updated.

GitHub for teamwork:
GitHub helps many people work on one project.
Each person can work on their own part using branches.
After finishing work, they send a Pull Request.
Other members can check the work and add it to the main project.
